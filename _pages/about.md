I am a PhD candidate at [CEMFI](https://www.cemfi.es/) with research interests in Financial Economics, Banking, and Corporate Finance.

I am on the job market in 2023-24, and available for interviews at the EEA and the ASSA.

## Research

### Banking on Resolution: Portfolio Effects of Bail-in vs. Bailout 
_Job market paper_ 
[[Draft](/files/Banking_resolution.pdf){: .btn--research2}]
<p> This paper investigates the impact of supervisory resolution tools, specifically bailins
versus bailouts, on the ex-ante banks’ portfolio composition and resulting default
probabilities in the presence of both idiosyncratic and systematic shocks. Banks make
decisions regarding short-term versus long-term asset investments while considering the
expected supervisory resolution policy. I find that market expectations can generate
financial instability, which the two resolution tools address through distinct channels.
Creditor bailouts, acting as debt insurance, reduce funding costs and by that eliminate
the equilibrium with bank defaults. Whereas, bail-ins alter bank payoffs, induce
banks to invest less in the risky short-term asset, and possibly prevent defaults. In
the presence of aggregate risk, I show that creditor bailouts can deter systemic events.
In contrast, bail-ins are less effective in preventing systemic defaults and could even
contribute to systemic risk. </p> 


### The Effect of Bank Mergers on Lending and Risk-Taking
<p> This paper investigates the effect of bank mergers on banks’ loan rates, leverage, and risk-taking. I consider an economy with n ≥ 3 banks where two of them merge for exogenous reasons. I assume that banks monitor borrowers, which lowers their probability of default, and that monitoring is costly and unobservable which creates a moral hazard problem. With insured deposits as the single source of funding, a merger generates higher loan rates, which in turn increases banks’ margins and monitoring intensities. Introducing equity capital as an additional source of funding enhances monitoring incentives, due to a “skin-in-the-game” effect, which increases loan demand. This creates a trade-off that results in nontrivial changes in post-merger capital, loan rates, and risk-taking. If loan rates increase following the merger, both the merged bank and its competitors increase their leverage. Higher loan rates and leverage exert opposing effects on monitoring intensity and, consequently, on risk-taking.</p>


### Banking Supervision and Bank Risk-Taking
joint with [Rafael Repullo](https://www.cemfi.es/~repullo/)
<p>This paper presents a theoretical analysis of the effects of banking supervision on bank risk-taking. The model features a risk-neutral bank that raises one unit of insured deposits and invests them in a large portfolio of loans. The bank chooses the extent of correlation in defaults, from σ = 0 (independent defaults) to σ = 1 (perfectly correlated defaults). The supervisor observes a noisy signal of the default rate (the proportion of loans that will default) and closes the bank early when the signal is above a threshold. The question is: will this combination of supervisory information and supervisory closure reduce risk-taking (the bank’s choice of σ)? The paper will shed light on the conditions under which a higher quality of supervisory information and/or a tougher closure rule will reduce banks’ risk-taking.</p>
